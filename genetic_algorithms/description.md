# Maximize Ones Genetic Algorithm ðŸ§¬ðŸ’¡

This repository contains a basic genetic algorithm implemented in Python that aims to maximize the number of ones in a fixed-length binary string (bitstring).

## Description ðŸ“š

The genetic algorithm provided includes the following components:

- **Initialization**: Randomly generates an initial population of binary strings with a specified size and length.
- **Fitness calculation**: Calculates the fitness of each individual in the population based on the number of ones in their bitstring.
- **Selection**: Selects parents for reproduction using a simple tournament selection.
- **Crossover**: Performs single-point crossover to generate offspring.
- **Mutation**: Introduces random bit flips in offspring with a specified mutation rate.
- **Termination**: The algorithm runs for a specified number of generations.

## Usage ðŸ’»

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the folder:


2. Modify the parameters in `maximize_ones_genetic_algorithm.py` if desired.

3. Run the script:

4. Observe the output displaying the best fitness for each generation and the final best individual.
